## Status
Started: 12/09/2024.

Finished: 16/09/2024.

Grade: 115%.

## Project Idea
All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

## Usage
``make`` to compile mandatory + Bonus part.

``./fdf maps/map_name.fdf``

## Guides
The most interesting part of any project is the research that goes behind it. If you are a student, please don't miss out on that opportunity by simply following guides such as these. In any case, they should under no circumstances be your only source of information about this project. Try things, fail, research, try again and succeed! And maybe write your own guide about it. Writing really is the best way to learn.
