When consuming a larger than expected amount of creatine in a single dose, episodes of diarrhea and nausea may occur. In this case, the dosages should be spread out over the day and taken with meals.
When creatine supplementation is taken without drinking enough water, stomach cramps may occur.
Creatine supplementation usually results in weight gain, partly due to an increase in total body water, which can be of particular concern for individuals competing in weight-sensitive sports.

</h2>

Creatine is beneficial for all strength-based exercises in all individuals. However, this benefit seems to be less noticeable in elite athletes than in novice athletes.
When it comes to studies conducted on whether or not a supplement can provide a benefit for sport and exercise, the first batch of studies are usually conducted on untrained or poorly trained people. There is a reason for this, and it is because this group of people are going to get benefits anyway when they start exercising and any interaction of the supplement is going to be more prominent to the researchers. It wasn't until later that researchers looked at elite athletes, as not only are they more unusual, but they tend to be more resistant to dietary supplements that benefit performance.
It is not uncommon for a supplement to benefit the beginner but fail the elite; does creatine, the king of ergogens, fall into this category?
Creatine supplementation has indeed shown benefits in athletes considered elite and has been shown to do so in: soccer (or football), volleyball, wrestling, swimming, and others. However, there are some occasions when creatine supplementation does not benefit elites, usually in situations that are not related to power explosions.
Ultimately, it appears that the magnitude of benefit is somewhat smaller, with studies in elite athletes recording smaller anti-fatigue effects and strength increases, which contrasts with supplementation promoting large strength gains in the novice athlete.

<pre class='ml-12 mt-5 text'>
Creatine is a widely studied and used dietary supplement in the field of sports nutrition. It is known for its positive effects on physical performance, muscle strength and body composition.
Creatine supplementation plays an important role in muscle energy production by increasing the availability of ATP. This supplementation can be done through loading cycles or just taking it, always with doses appropriate for each individual.
It is important to point out that creatine can have side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, and increased body weight due to water retention. Therefore, adequate water intake is essential when supplementing creatine.
Nutrition professionals should consider all the individual factors of each client, such as goals, type of sports, and overall health, when recommending creatine supplementation. It is critical to closely monitor the effects and adjust as necessary to ensure maximum safety and effectiveness of creatine use.
